Step 1: Install the Required Package
Use the following Composer command to install the PhpSpreadsheet library:

```php
composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
```
This will add PhpSpreadsheet to your Laravel project and allow you to use the classes you mentioned, such as PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Csv and PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet.

2.Enable ZIP Extension
PhpSpreadsheet requires the PHP zip extension to be enabled for Excel file handling. To enable it, ensure that this line is uncommented in your php.ini:

```php
extension=zip
```
Enable GD or Imagick Extension (for Images in Excel Files)
If you are working with images in Excel files, you will need either GD or Imagick extension enabled:

```php
extension=gd
; OR
extension=imagick
```
Increase Memory Limit
Large files may require more memory to be processed. Increase the memory limit:

```php
memory_limit = 256M
```
You can set it to a higher value like 512M or 1G if youâ€™re dealing with really large files.

Set Upload File Size Limit
If you are importing files, you may need to allow larger file uploads:

```php
upload_max_filesize = 50M
post_max_size = 50M
```
Set these to values that suit your file size requirements.

<h3>composer require maatwebsite/excel:"^1.1" phpoffice/phpspreadsheet:"1.28"
</h3>
<h2>For pdf format download file</h2>
Step: Verify DOMPDF Installation
If the above steps still result in the error, verify the package is installed correctly by running:

```php
composer show barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
```
This should display information about the installed package. If not, try reinstalling the package:

```php
composer remove barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
```
```php
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:cache
```
Step 6: Test a Simple PDF
```php
use Barryvdh\DomPDF\Facade\Pdf;  // Correctly import the facade

public function testPdf()
{
    $pdf = Pdf::loadHTML('<h1>Testing PDF</h1>');
    return $pdf->download('test.pdf');
}
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
